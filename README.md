The IoT-Based Water Quality Detection System combines IoT technology with machine learning algorithms to monitor and predict water quality parameters based on real-time pH sensor data. This project leverages Arduino, NodeMCU, and a pH sensor to collect water quality metrics, which are then processed and analyzed using machine learning models. The system includes a frontend interface for visualizing data, enabling users to monitor and manage water quality remotely
