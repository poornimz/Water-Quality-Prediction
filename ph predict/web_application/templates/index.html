						<h3>PH</h3>
						<p>pH is an important indicator of chemical, physical, and biological changes in a waterbody and plays a critical role in chemical processes in natural waters. pH values are on a scale from 0 to 14, with 7.0 considered neutral.The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral, less than 7 being acidic, and greater than 7 being alkaline. The EPA recommends that tap water have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5, depending on the system and what protects aquatic life.

							FACTSHEET ON WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS
							What are EPA's recommended ambient water quality criteria for pH? In EPA's Quality Criteria for Water (1986), the recommended water criteria for pH ranges from 6.5 to 9.0 depending on what is protective of aquatic life and the particular system (fresh vs saltwater). Page 3. pH. 3. How do we measure pH? pH can be measured in the field using a water quality probe, indicator tests or strips, or from grab samples. Most commonly pH is measured in the field along with other water quality parameter measurements including temperature, dissolved oxygen, and specific conductance using a single or multi-parameter probe.

							22 Oct 2019 â€” pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base. pH is really a measure of the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in the water.

						<h3>quality analysis</h3>
						<p>Generally water quality assessment involves analysis of some physico-chemical, biological and microbiological parameters and reflects a-biotic and biotic status of the ecosystem. Such an assessment, in turn, helps in planning, utilization and antipollution and conversation strategies for their sustainable use. Among different parameters analyzed in the water quality assessment, the primary water quality criteria is based on 4 to 5 important ones, these are pH value, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total coliform (MPN). Nevertheless, other parameters are also important as indicators of water quality. </p>

				<p>WHO produces international norms on water quality and human health in the form of guidelines that are used as the basis for regulation and standard setting world-wide.

					The Guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) promote the protection of public health by advocating for the development of locally relevant standards and regulations (health based targets), adoption of preventive risk management approaches covering catchment to consumer (Water Safety Plans) and independent surveillance to ensure that Water Safety Plans are being implemented and effective and that national standards are being met.</p>
