								<h3>Services Title 1</h3>
								<p>Not only is the agricultural sector the biggest consumer of global freshwater resources, with farming and livestock production using about 70 percent of the earth’s surface water supplies, but it’s also a serious water polluter. Around the world, agriculture is the leading cause of water degradation. In the United States, agricultural pollution is the top source of contamination in rivers and streams, the second-biggest source in wetlands, and the third main source in lakes. It’s also a major contributor of contamination to estuaries and groundwater. Every time it rains, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste from farms and livestock operations wash nutrients and pathogens—such bacteria and viruses—into our waterways. Nutrient pollution, caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus in water or air, is the number-one threat to water quality worldwide and can cause algal blooms, a toxic soup of blue-green algae that can be harmful to people and wildlife..</p>

								<h3>Services Title 2</h3>
								<p>Maintaining water quality in various systems, such as aquariums or pools, involves regular monitoring and adjustment of pH levels. The frequency and duration of maintenance depend on several factors, including the specific requirements of the system, the initial pH level, the type of organisms in the water, and external factors like temperature and usage. Here's a general guideline:

									1. **Monitoring**: Regularly test the pH level of the water using appropriate testing kits. The frequency of testing can vary from daily to weekly, depending on the stability of the system and the sensitivity of the organisms to pH fluctuations.
									
									2. **Adjustment**: If the pH level goes out of the desired range, corrective action is needed. The appropriate method for adjusting pH depends on whether it needs to be increased or decreased. Common pH-adjusting chemicals include pH-up (to raise pH) and pH-down (to lower pH).
									
									3. **Duration of Adjustment**: The duration required to bring the pH back into the desired range can vary based on the severity of the deviation and the effectiveness of the chosen adjustment method. It may take a few hours to a few days for the pH to stabilize after adjustments.
									
									4. **Stability**: Once the pH level is within the desired range, it's essential to monitor it regularly to ensure stability. Sudden changes in pH can stress organisms and lead to health issues.
									
									5. **Preventive Maintenance**: Implementing preventive measures, such as regular water changes, proper filtration, and avoiding the introduction of pH-altering substances, can help maintain stable pH levels and reduce the frequency of adjustments.
									
									6. **Consultation**: If you're unsure about how to maintain water quality or how to address pH fluctuations, it's advisable to consult with a professional or refer to specific guidelines for the type of system you're managing.
									
									Remember that maintaining water quality is crucial for the health and well-being of the organisms within the system, so consistent monitoring and timely adjustments are key..</p>

					The maintenance schedule for water quality, including pH adjustment, can vary depending on the specific system and its requirements. Here's a general guideline for different types of systems:
					
					Aquariums:
					Daily: Check water temperature and visually inspect fish for signs of stress or illness.
					Weekly: Test pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels. Perform a partial water change (about 10-25% of the total volume). Clean the substrate and filter media.
					Monthly: Clean the aquarium glass, decorations, and equipment. Trim plants if necessary.
					Swimming Pools:
					Daily: Skim the surface for debris and check the water level.
					Weekly: Test pH, chlorine, alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels. Shock the pool if needed. Brush the walls and vacuum the pool floor.
					Monthly: Clean the skimmer and pump baskets. Backwash or clean the filter as per manufacturer's instructions.
					Hydroponic Systems:
					Daily: Monitor pH and nutrient levels. Check for clogs in tubing or drippers.
					Weekly: Adjust pH and nutrient levels as needed. Clean or replace air and water filters.
					Monthly: Flush the system with clean water to prevent salt buildup. Inspect the system for leaks or damage.
					Drinking Water Systems:
					Daily: Inspect the system for leaks or unusual odors/tastes in the water.
					Weekly: Test pH and disinfectant levels (e.g., chlorine or chloramine). Flush the system if necessary.
					Quarterly: Replace filters and cartridges according to manufacturer's recommendations. Perform a thorough cleaning of the system components.
					Water Gardens or Ponds:
					Daily: Check for signs of algae growth or water discoloration.
					Weekly: Test pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels. Remove debris from the surface and bottom of the pond.
					Monthly: Trim aquatic plants and inspect the pump and filtration system for clogs.</p>
